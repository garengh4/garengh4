### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Garen and I am an Electrical Eng. Grad! I work mainly with springboot and Angular, and sometimes go into and NodeJS...

My current mission is finding and understanding the best architecture for this angular-springboot stack: I am currently convinced object-oriented backend at @input/@output frontend is the one.

In my spare time I love to game, read and teach my cat tricks :):)
