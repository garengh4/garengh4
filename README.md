### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Garen! I am currently an Electrical Eng. graduate with an interest in developing software applications. I am focusing on security and structure that allows for code maintainability without compromise down the road. I am confident in Java and Angular, and will consider looking at python in the near future :)

In my spare time I love to read and go on hikes with my cat.
