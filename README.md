### Welcome! 👋

Hi, My name is Garen and I am an Electrical Eng. Grad! I work mainly with java springboot and sometimes delve into Angular and NodeJS. 

My mission in life is code readability with intent for easy down-the-road maintainence. I am currently working with Eureka microservice and Jdbc.

In my spare time I love to read and go on hikes with my cat. :):)
