### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, My name is Garen and I am an Electrical Eng. Grad! I work mainly with java springboot and sometimes delve into Angular and NodeJS. 

My current mission is code readability because I believe beingAbleToTeach = fullyUnderstanding. This as a result has pushed me to Object-Oriented principles and Model-View-Controller architecture.

Currently I am working on:
- Mockito 
- JdbcTemplate
- CrudRepository and JpaRepository 
- Netflix Eureka and RestTemplate

In my spare time I love to read and go on hikes with my cat. :):)
